# Location Alarm

An app that sounds an alarm when you enter a geofence.
Also an excuse to learn multiplatform app development with KMM

MVP:

- Android Only
  - Unit Tests & refactoring
  - UI Tests?
- IOS
  - Location when backgrounded
  - Sticky notification on lock screen with distance to alarm
    - Red when alarm going off
    - Stop alarm action
    - Open app on tap
  - Full screen UI
  - Alarm alert UI

Cool things i wanna do eventually, maybe:

- IOS Lock screen widget
- Code quality
- CI / CD
- Bug & crash reporting
- Alarm config (sound, vibration pattern)
- Recent geofences
- Favourite geofences
- Multiple labelled geofences, seperately toggleable
- Voice commands "Hey google, wake me when i get to woolwhich"
- Sign in and sync
- Other actions when in geofence
- Inverse location alarm (anchor watch)
- Polygonal geofence areas
- Weekly notifications - caught up on x hours extra sleep this week
- Apple watch app / Android watch app
