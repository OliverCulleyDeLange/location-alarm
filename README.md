# Location Alarm

- An app that sounds an alarm when you enter a geofence.
- Also an excuse to learn multiplatform app development with KMM.
- Also an excuse to play with fun things like ios widgets, voice commands, watch apps, ya know,
  cool shit you wouldn't usually play with.

MVP:
- App icon
  - Add icon to live activity & notification

Things i wanna do eventually, maybe:

- Unit Tests & refactoring
- UI Tests?
- Code quality
- CI / CD
- Bug & crash reporting
- Debugging tool that captures GPX file for alarm enabled session - to aid GPS issue debugging
- Alarm config (sound, vibration pattern)
- Recent geofences
- Favourite geofences
- Multiple labelled geofences, seperately toggleable
- Voice commands "Hey google, wake me when i get to woolwhich"
- Sign in and sync
- Other actions when in geofence
- Inverse location alarm (anchor watch)
- Polygonal geofence areas
- Weekly notifications - caught up on x hours extra sleep this week
- Apple watch app / Android watch app
